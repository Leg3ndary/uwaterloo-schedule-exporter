Export your University of Waterloo class schedule directly from [Quest.](https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/)

This is a fork of a fork meant to create multiple different calendars for each type of calendar event (e.g. lectures, tutorials, labs, etc) for my personal use.

## Usage

1. Add instructions on how to add custom extension

2. Go to Class Schedule, select the term, then select Weekly Calendar View and return to List View. Switching back and forth is required to load the document so the extension can recognize this event.
